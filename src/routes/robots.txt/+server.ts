/**
 * GET /robots.txt — crawl rules, AI crawler policy, and Content Signals.
 *
 * Served as a route rather than a file in `static/` for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. The `Sitemap:` line and the host it points at are derived from the live
 *     request origin, so this file is correct on localhost, on preview deploys,
 *     and on a custom domain without anyone editing it.
 *  2. `bun run customize` only rewrites .ts/.js/.svelte/.json/.toml/.md/.html —
 *     a static .txt would silently keep the template's URL forever.
 *
 * Policy lives in src/lib/agent-discovery.ts; this module only formats it.
 * Format follows RFC 9309; Content-Signal follows contentsignals.org.
