/**
 * Single source of truth for app identity, branding, and local-dev config.
 *
 * Surfaces that cannot import this module — wrangler.toml, tests, docs,
 * src/app.html, static/site.webmanifest — are updated by hand, in the same
 * change. There is no rebranding script.
 *
 * Everything that runs (Vite, Playwright, and every Svelte component) imports its
 * name/port/URL from here, so these values live in exactly one place.
 *
 * This module must stay dependency-free (no `$app`, no Node APIs) so that
 * vite.config.ts and playwright.config.ts can import it directly.
